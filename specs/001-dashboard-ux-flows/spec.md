# Feature Specification: Main Dashboard and User Experience Flows

**Feature Branch**: `001-dashboard-ux-flows`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Main dashboard and user experience flows including workout programs, meal plans, and community navigation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Dashboard Overview and Quick Actions (Priority: P1)

Users need an at-a-glance view of their fitness progress and quick access to primary actions (log workout, view meal plan, check progress). The dashboard serves as the central hub where users start their daily fitness journey.

**Why this priority**: The dashboard is the entry point for all user activities. Without it, users cannot navigate to other features. It's the MVP foundation that enables all other user flows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the app and verifying that the dashboard displays with summary cards, quick action buttons, and navigation to main sections. Delivers immediate value by showing progress overview.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has logged workouts and meals, **When** they open the app, **Then** the dashboard displays summary cards showing today's workout status, meal plan adherence, current streak, and recent achievements.
2. **Given** a new user with no activity history, **When** they open the app, **Then** the dashboard displays welcome content with onboarding prompts and empty state cards encouraging first workout or meal logging.
3. **Given** a user is on the dashboard, **When** they tap the "Log Workout" quick action button, **Then** they are navigated to the workout logging screen.
4. **Given** a user is on the dashboard, **When** they pull down to refresh, **Then** the dashboard data is updated with the latest information from the server.
5. **Given** a user has completed today's workout and meal goals, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** visual indicators (checkmarks, progress rings) show completion status.

### User Story 2 - Workout Programs Navigation and Discovery (Priority: P2)

Users need to discover, browse, and select workout programs that match their fitness goals. They should be able to view program details, see previews, and start or continue their current program.

**Why this priority**: Workout programs are a core value proposition of the app. After seeing the dashboard, users need to select and engage with structured programs to achieve their fitness goals.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by navigating to the workout programs section, browsing available programs, viewing program details, and starting a program. Delivers value by helping users find structured workout guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the dashboard, **When** they tap the "Workout Programs" navigation item, **Then** they see a screen listing available workout programs organized by category (strength, cardio, flexibility, beginner-friendly).
2. **Given** a user is viewing the workout programs list, **When** they tap on a program card, **Then** they see the program detail screen showing description, duration, difficulty level, equipment needed, and sample workout preview.
3. **Given** a user is viewing a program detail screen, **When** they tap "Start Program", **Then** the program is activated and they are navigated to the first workout session.
4. **Given** a user has an active program in progress, **When** they navigate to workout programs, **Then** their current program is prominently displayed at the top with progress indication and a "Continue" button.
5. **Given** a user is browsing programs, **When** they use the filter options, **Then** programs are filtered by difficulty level, duration, equipment requirements, or fitness goal.
6. **Given** a user has no internet connection, **When** they access workout programs, **Then** previously downloaded programs are available offline with a clear indicator of offline mode.

### User Story 3 - Meal Plans Navigation and Access (Priority: P3)

Users need to access their personalized meal plans, view daily meal schedules, and see nutritional information. This helps them maintain dietary adherence aligned with their fitness goals.

**Why this priority**: Nutrition is complementary to workouts but not immediately critical for a functional MVP. Users can track workouts without meal plans, but meal plans significantly enhance overall fitness outcomes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to meal plans, viewing today's meals, accessing nutritional details, and marking meals as completed. Delivers value by providing dietary guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the dashboard, **When** they tap the "Meal Plans" navigation item, **Then** they see the meal plan screen showing today's meal schedule with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
2. **Given** a user is viewing their meal plan, **When** they tap on a meal card, **Then** they see detailed information including ingredients, preparation instructions, nutritional breakdown (calories, macros), and portion sizes.
3. **Given** a user has completed a meal, **When** they tap the "Mark as Complete" button on a meal card, **Then** the meal is marked as done and their daily nutritional progress is updated.
4. **Given** a user is on the meal plan screen, **When** they swipe or navigate to a different day, **Then** they can view meal plans for past or future days within their plan period.
5. **Given** a user wants to customize their meal plan, **When** they tap "Customize" on a meal, **Then** they see options to swap the meal with alternatives that match similar nutritional profiles.

---

### User Story 4 - Community Navigation and Engagement (Priority: P4)

Users can connect with other app users, share progress, participate in challenges, and get motivation from the community. This fosters engagement and accountability.

**Why this priority**: Social features enhance retention but are not essential for core functionality. Users can achieve fitness goals independently before needing community support.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the community section, viewing activity feeds, interacting with posts, and accessing challenges. Delivers value through motivation and social accountability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the dashboard, **When** they tap the "Community" navigation item, **Then** they see a feed of recent community activities, posts from users they follow, and trending challenges.
2. **Given** a user is viewing the community feed, **When** they tap on a post, **Then** they see the full post details with comments, likes, and the option to engage.
3. **Given** a user wants to share their progress, **When** they tap the "Share Progress" button from the dashboard or community section, **Then** they can create a post with workout stats, photos, or achievement badges.
4. **Given** a user is viewing the community section, **When** they tap on "Challenges", **Then** they see active challenges they can join, their current challenge progress, and leaderboards.
5. **Given** a user completes a challenge milestone, **When** the achievement is recorded, **Then** they receive a notification and see the badge displayed in their profile and shareable to the community.

### User Story 5 - Bottom Navigation and Screen Transitions (Priority: P1)

Users need consistent, intuitive navigation between all major sections of the app with clear visual feedback on current location and smooth transitions.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is fundamental infrastructure required for P1-P4 to function. Without navigation, users cannot access any features. This is part of the P1 MVP alongside the dashboard.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by tapping navigation items and verifying smooth transitions, active state indicators, and proper back navigation. Delivers core usability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on any screen, **When** they view the bottom navigation bar, **Then** they see navigation items for Dashboard, Workouts, Meal Plans, Community, and Profile with clear icons and labels.
2. **Given** a user is on the Dashboard, **When** they tap the "Workouts" navigation item, **Then** they are smoothly transitioned to the Workouts screen and the navigation bar highlights the Workouts item.
3. **Given** a user is viewing a nested screen (e.g., workout program details), **When** they use the back button or gesture, **Then** they navigate back to the parent screen (workout programs list) while maintaining the correct navigation state.
4. **Given** a user is navigating between screens, **When** transitions occur, **Then** animations are smooth (60fps), respect system reduced motion settings, and complete within 300ms.
5. **Given** a user taps a navigation item for their current screen, **When** the tap is registered, **Then** the screen scrolls to the top without navigating away (tap-to-top behavior).

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no active workout program but tries to access the "Continue Program" quick action on the dashboard?
  - System should gracefully handle this by showing a message prompting the user to select a new program and navigating to the workout programs list.

- What happens when network connectivity is lost mid-navigation between sections?
  - System should display offline mode indicators and allow access to previously cached content. Real-time data (community feed, new programs) should show a friendly offline message with retry option.

- What happens when a user has completed all available workout programs?
  - Dashboard should show completion status and encourage exploring new programs, repeating favorites, or creating custom workouts.

- How does the system handle extremely long data loads (e.g., large community feed with images)?
  - Progressive loading with skeleton screens for initial state, pagination/infinite scroll for community feed, and image lazy loading to maintain smooth scrolling performance.

- What happens when a user rapid-taps navigation items or buttons?
  - Navigation should debounce taps to prevent duplicate navigation events or multiple overlapping screen transitions.

- How does the system handle users with accessibility settings (large text, screen readers)?
  - All navigation items must have proper semantic labels, touch targets meet minimum 48dp size, and text scales appropriately without breaking layouts. Screen readers should announce navigation changes.

- What happens when push notifications redirect users from a notification to a specific screen while they're in the middle of another flow?
  - System should save navigation state, navigate to the deep-linked screen, and provide clear back navigation to return to previous context or restart from dashboard.

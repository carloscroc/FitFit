# Specification Quality Checklist: Main Dashboard and User Experience Flows

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ The specification is written entirely from a user and business perspective without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches.
- ✅ All language focuses on what users need to accomplish and what value they receive.
- ✅ Technical constraints are described in user-facing terms (e.g., "3 seconds" rather than "database query optimization").
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are thoroughly completed.

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist in the specification. All requirements are fully defined.
- ✅ All 28 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. Each uses clear MUST statements with measurable criteria.
- ✅ All 20 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, count, user behavior).
- ✅ Success criteria are written in user-facing, technology-agnostic language (e.g., "Dashboard loads within 3 seconds" not "API response time under 500ms").
- ✅ Each user story includes multiple acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.
- ✅ Comprehensive edge cases are documented covering offline mode, accessibility, rapid interactions, empty states, and notification deep linking.
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded to dashboard and navigation flows; does not extend to implementation of workout logging, profile management, or other features referenced but not specified.
- ✅ Key entities are described conceptually without prescribing data models or storage mechanisms.

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ All functional requirements map to user scenarios and success criteria, creating a coherent feature definition.
- ✅ User scenarios are prioritized (P1-P4) with clear independence testing criteria.
- ✅ The specification provides complete guidance for planning phase without requiring additional clarification.
- ✅ Zero implementation details detected; specification remains technology-neutral throughout.

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED - Ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

The specification meets all quality criteria and provides a complete, testable foundation for implementation planning. All requirements are clear, measurable, and user-focused. No clarifications needed.

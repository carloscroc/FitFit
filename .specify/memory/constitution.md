# FitFit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Performance First

**Requirements:**
- App MUST launch in under 3 seconds on mid-range devices (defined as devices from the last 3 years with ≥4GB RAM).
- Network API calls MUST target <500ms response time at p95 percentile.
- Core tracking features (workout logging, progress viewing, basic analytics) MUST function offline without degradation.
- Local data synchronization MUST occur seamlessly when connectivity is restored.

**Rationale:** Fitness tracking is a time-sensitive activity. Users often log workouts in environments with poor connectivity (gyms, outdoor locations). A slow or unresponsive app will lead to abandonment and poor user retention.

---

### II. Security & Privacy

**Requirements:**
- All personal data (health metrics, user profiles, workout history) MUST be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256).
- Authentication MUST use OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens; refresh tokens stored securely in platform keychain.
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies MUST be enabled for all user data tables.
- GDPR and CCPA compliance MUST be maintained: user data export, deletion requests, and consent management.
- Credentials MUST NEVER be stored in plaintext; only encrypted tokens in secure storage.
- Third-party analytics MUST be privacy-preserving (anonymized, opt-in where legally required).

**Rationale:** Health and fitness data is highly sensitive personal information. Any breach or mishandling damages user trust irreparably and exposes the project to legal liability. Privacy-first design is non-negotiable.

---

### III. Testing & Reliability

**Requirements:**
- Business logic (services, state management, models, data validation) MUST maintain ≥90% unit test coverage.
- UI widgets and screens MUST have widget tests for critical user paths (authentication, workout creation, progress tracking).
- Integration tests MUST cover: Supabase interactions, authentication flows, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notifications.
- All exceptions MUST be caught, logged with structured context (user action, device info, stack trace), and reported via crash analytics (e.g., Crashlytics, Sentry).
- Release builds MUST have zero unhandled exceptions that cause app termination (crash-free rate target: 99.5%).
- Regression test suite MUST run on every PR; failing tests block merge.

**Rationale:** Fitness tracking relies on data integrity and app reliability. Lost workout data or app crashes during logging destroy user confidence. High test coverage and robust error handling are essential to maintain production stability.

---

### IV. Accessibility & UX Excellence

**Requirements:**
- MUST meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance: semantic labels, sufficient color contrast (≥4.5:1 for text), keyboard navigation support.
- Dark mode and light mode MUST have feature parity; all UI elements must be equally readable and functional in both themes.
- Touch targets MUST be ≥48dp per Material Design guidelines; interactive elements clearly distinguished.
- Animations and transitions MUST respect system accessibility settings (reduced motion).
- Typography MUST scale with system font size settings; no hardcoded text sizes that break accessibility.
- UI/UX MUST be meticulously crafted: consistent spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy across all screens.
- Design reviews MUST verify pixel-perfect implementation of Figma/design specs before PR approval.
- User feedback (loading states, error messages, success confirmations) MUST be immediate, clear, and actionable.

**Rationale:** Fitness apps serve diverse user populations, including those with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments. Accessible design is not optional. Meticulous UI/UX ensures the app is delightful to use, which drives engagement and retention. Poor UX in fitness apps leads to immediate uninstalls.

---

### V. Scalability

**Requirements:**
- Architecture MUST be designed to support ≥100,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- Supabase database queries MUST use proper indexing; query performance monitored and optimized (≤100ms for common reads).
- Static assets (images, videos, workout animations) MUST be served via CDN (Supabase Storage or equivalent).
- API endpoints MUST implement rate limiting and caching strategies to prevent abuse and reduce load.
- Horizontal scaling strategies MUST be documented for backend services (serverless functions, database read replicas).

**Rationale:** While initial user base may be smaller, the architecture must not require fundamental rewrites as the user base grows. Designing for scale from the start prevents costly refactoring and downtime during growth phases.

---

### VI. Design Language

**Requirements:**
- MUST use Material 3 design system: design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.
- Brand color palette MUST be consistently applied via theme configuration (primary, secondary, tertiary, error colors).
- Typography MUST follow brand guidelines (font families, weights, sizes) defined in theme tokens.
- Component styling MUST reuse Material 3 widgets; custom components only when Material 3 lacks functionality.
- Design system updates MUST propagate globally via theme changes, not per-component overrides.

**Rationale:** Visual consistency builds brand recognition and trust. Material 3 provides a proven, accessible design foundation. Centralized theme management ensures scalability and maintainability of UI code.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements

- All pull requests MUST pass automated checks: linting, formatting, unit tests, integration tests.
- Security-sensitive changes (authentication, data encryption, API endpoints) MUST receive security review from designated team member or external auditor.
- UI/UX changes MUST include screenshots/recordings and receive design review for consistency with Figma specs and Design Language principles.
- Breaking changes to APIs or data models MUST be documented with migration guides.

### Branching & Commits

- Feature branches MUST follow naming convention: `feature/###-feature-name` (where ### is issue/ticket number).
- Commit messages MUST follow Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(auth): add biometric login`).
- Main branch MUST always be deployable; failing CI on main triggers immediate rollback or hotfix.

### Documentation

- Public APIs and services MUST have inline documentation (Dart doc comments).
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) MUST be created for significant technical decisions (database schema changes, third-party integrations, architecture patterns).
- User-facing features MUST have corresponding updates to user documentation or in-app help.

---

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Proposed constitution changes MUST be submitted via pull request to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
2. Team consensus (unanimous approval from all active maintainers) MUST be achieved before merging.
3. Constitution version MUST be updated following semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Removal or redefinition of existing principles (backward-incompatible).
   - **MINOR**: Addition of new principles or sections (backward-compatible expansion).
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes (non-semantic).
4. Ratification date remains unchanged; Last Amended date MUST be updated to merge date.
5. Sync Impact Report MUST be included documenting affected templates and follow-up actions.

### Compliance Review

- Feature specifications (`/specs/###-feature-name/spec.md`) MUST verify alignment with all applicable principles before implementation begins.
- Implementation plans (`/specs/###-feature-name/plan.md`) MUST include a "Constitution Check" section documenting compliance or justified exceptions.
- Complexity or principle violations MUST be explicitly justified in the Complexity Tracking section of `plan.md`.
- Post-implementation reviews MUST verify that delivered features adhere to constitution requirements.

### Enforcement

- This constitution supersedes all other development practices, style guides, or informal agreements.
- Pull requests violating constitution principles without documented justification MUST be rejected.
- Repeated violations indicate insufficient understanding of principles; require team training or documentation updates.
